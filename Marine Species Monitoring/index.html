        <p>We focus on investigating a wide range of marine ecosystems, from coral reefs to deep-sea environments. <br> Our drones collect vital data on marine species diversity, behavior, and population trends. <br>Our research is divided into several key projects:
        Coral Reef Monitoring: Studying the impact of climate change on coral species and their ecosystems.
        Deep-Sea Exploration: Documenting species diversity in unexplored oceanic depths.Fish Population Studies: Tracking fish populations to analyze ecosystem health and sustainability.In collaboration with leading marine research institutes, we use this data to drive both scientific discovery and practical conservation measures.</p>

    <!-- Process Section -->
    <section id="process" class="section">
        <h2>Our Process.</h2>
        <p>Our research process is carefully structured to ensure the highest accuracy in species identification and data collection.</p>
        <p>Planning and Preparation: Our team identifies specific marine environments and species that require monitoring. We coordinate with local authorities, researchers, and environmental groups to define research objectives.
            Deployment: Using advanced underwater drones equipped with high-definition cameras, sonar, and sensors, we collect footage and data on marine species in real-time. The drones can explore various depths, from shallow coral reefs to the deep sea.
            Data Analysis: Once data is collected, we utilize advanced algorithms and AI technologies to identify species, map habitats, and analyze behavioral patterns. The processed data is then verified by marine biologists.
            Results and Reporting: We share our findings with research institutions, conservation organizations, and government agencies, contributing to the global database on marine biodiversity. Results are also made available to the public through open-access platforms.</p>

    <!-- Technology Section -->
    <section id="technology" class="section">
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Our underwater drone technology combines innovation and practicality to offer a comprehensive solution for marine species identification.
        Drones: Our fleet of drones is equipped with high-resolution cameras, sonar, and various environmental sensors. They can operate autonomously or be remotely controlled, capturing data from challenging environments.
            Artificial Intelligence: AI plays a crucial role in processing the large amounts of data collected. By identifying species based on their physical features and behavior, AI helps streamline the data analysis process.
            Live Monitoring: Our drones provide live data feeds, enabling researchers to monitor marine species in real-time. This allows for immediate identification and timely interventions when necessary.
            Data Security: We ensure that all data collected is securely stored and protected, while still promoting data sharing within the scientific community.
        With this technology, we hope to create a detailed and constantly evolving map of marine biodiversity that will help scientists better understand and protect the ocean's ecosystems.</p>
